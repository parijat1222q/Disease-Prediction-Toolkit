# Disease-Prediction-Toolkit
This project demonstrates how **Machine Learning** can be applied in healthcare to predict heart disease.   We trained multiple ML models (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest) on the **UCI Heart Disease Dataset**.   The toolkit includes preprocessing, training, evaluation, visualizations, and predictions for new patient data.
